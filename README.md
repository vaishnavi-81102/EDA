# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is part of a Data Analyst Internship Task 5. The objective is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the classic [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data). It contains information about passengers and whether they survived the Titanic shipwreck.

**File Used:** `datasets_11657_16098_train.csv`

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🔍 EDA Tasks Performed

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Viewing top rows, data types, and null values
2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Dropped `Cabin`, filled missing `Age` and `Embarked`
3. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Distribution plots for Age, Fare
   - Count plots for Survived, Pclass, Sex
4. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Survival rate by Gender, Class, and Age
5. **Multivariate Analysis**
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Pairplots
6. **Insights**
   - Females and 1st class passengers had higher survival rates
   - Higher fare and younger age groups were more likely to survive

## 📊 Output

The main analysis is provided in the Jupyter Notebook:
- `Titanic_EDA_Task5.ipynb`
